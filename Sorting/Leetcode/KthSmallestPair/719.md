# Smallest Distance Pair Problem

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the `Smallest Distance Pair` problem, which finds the `k`-th smallest distance pair among a list of integers.

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th smallest distance among all the pairs in the array. The distance of a pair `(A, B)` is defined as `|A - B|`, where `A` and `B` are elements of the array.

## Approach

1. **Sorting**:
   - First, the array `nums` is sorted. Sorting simplifies the process of calculating distances between pairs and helps in efficiently counting the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to a given value.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The algorithm employs a binary search on the possible distance values. The range of possible distances starts from `0` (when both elements of the pair are equal) to the maximum possible distance, which is the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - A helper function `slidingWindowCount` is used to count the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to a given value `mid`. This function uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of valid pairs.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - During the binary search, if the number of pairs with distance less than or equal to `mid` is less than `k`, the search continues in the upper half. Otherwise, it stores the current `mid` as a potential result and continues the search in the lower half.

### Helper Function

- **`slidingWindowCount()`**:
  - This function counts the number of pairs whose distance is less than or equal to `d` using a sliding window approach. It increments the count by the number of valid pairs found during each iteration.

### Algorithm Flow

- **Binary Search**:
  - The binary search narrows down the possible distance values until the exact `k`-th smallest distance is found. The search continues until the left and right pointers converge, ensuring the smallest possible distance that satisfies the condition is returned.

## Example Usage

Given the following input:
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 1};
int k = 1;
Solution ob;
int result = ob.smallestDistancePair(nums, k);
cout << result << endl;
