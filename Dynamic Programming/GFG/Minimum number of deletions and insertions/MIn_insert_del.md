# Minimum Operations to Convert String Problem

## Problem Explanation

The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string (`str1`) into another string (`str2`). The allowed operations are:
- **Insertion:** Add a character to `str1`.
- **Deletion:** Remove a character from `str1`.

The task is to compute the minimum number of these operations required to transform `str1` into `str2`.

**Detailed Problem Statement:**
- Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, you need to find the minimum number of insertions and deletions required to convert `str1` into `str2`.
- The approach is to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two strings. The characters that are not part of the LCS in `str1` need to be deleted, and the characters that are missing in `str1` but are part of `str2` need to be inserted.

For example, if `str1 = "heap"` and `str2 = "pea"`, the longest common subsequence is `"ea"`. The minimum number of operations required is `3` (delete `"h"` from `str1` and then insert `"p"` and `"a"` into `str1`).

## Solution Approach

The solution approach is based on finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two strings and then using the result to compute the number of insertions and deletions required.

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:**
   - The `dp` table is a 2D vector `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i` is the index in the first string `s1`.
     - `j` is the index in the second string `s2`.
   - The value `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS up to the indices `i` and `j`.

2. **Recursive Function (help):**
   - The `help` function is used to recursively calculate the length of the LCS between `s1` and `s2`.
   - If the characters at indices `i-1` and `j-1` in `s1` and `s2` match, the LCS length is incremented by `1` and the function continues to check the previous characters (`i-1`, `j-1`).
   - If the characters do not match, the function tries to find the maximum LCS by either ignoring the current character in `s1` or `s2` and continues recursively.
   - The results are stored in the `dp` table to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Once the LCS length is computed, the minimum number of deletions required in `str1` is `n - LCS` and the minimum number of insertions required is `m - LCS`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.
   - The total minimum number of operations is the sum of deletions and insertions.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The solution returns the total number of operations required to convert `str1` into `str2`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the length of `str1` and `m` is the length of `str2`. This complexity arises from filling the `n x m` DP table.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is **O(n * m)**, required to store the `dp` table with dimensions corresponding to the lengths of the two strings. The space used by the recursion stack is also proportional to `O(n * m)`.
