# Fibonacci Sequence Using Memoization

This repository contains a C++ implementation of calculating the nth Fibonacci number using memoization to optimize recursive calls.

## Problem Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The task is to compute the nth Fibonacci number efficiently.

## Approach

1. **Recursive Function with Memoization**:
   - Define a helper function `find` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
   - Use a memoization array `dp` to store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If the value for the current Fibonacci number is already computed and stored in `dp`, return it.
   - Otherwise, compute the value recursively and store it in `dp` before returning.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The base cases are when `n` is 0 or 1, directly returning `n` as the Fibonacci number.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a vector `dp` with -1 to indicate uncomputed Fibonacci numbers.
   - Set `dp[0]` to 0 and `dp[1]` to 1.

4. **Main Function**:
   - The `fib` function initializes the `dp` vector and calls the `find` function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

## Functions

- **fib**: Main function to initialize the `dp` vector and call the helper function `find`.
- **find**: Helper function that computes the nth Fibonacci number using memoization.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), because each Fibonacci number from 0 to n is computed exactly once and stored in the memoization array.

## Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for storing the memoization array `dp`.

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `fib` function. It reads the value of `n` and calls the `fib` function to compute the nth Fibonacci number, printing the result.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int find(int n, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (dp[n] != -1) {
            return dp[n];
        }
        dp[n] = find(n - 1, dp) + find(n - 2, dp);
        return dp[n];
    }

    int fib(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, -1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        return find(n, dp);
    }
};
