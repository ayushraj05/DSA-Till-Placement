# House Robber II Problem Using Dynamic Programming

This repository contains a C++ implementation to solve the "House Robber II" problem using dynamic programming. In this variant of the house robber problem, the houses are arranged in a circle, meaning the first and last houses are adjacent.

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses are arranged in a circle, and you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Your goal is to maximize the amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming with Two Scenarios**:
   - Since the houses are arranged in a circle, you cannot rob both the first and last houses.
   - The problem is broken down into two scenarios:
     1. Robbing houses from index 0 to `n-2` (excluding the last house).
     2. Robbing houses from index 1 to `n-1` (excluding the first house).
   - The final result is the maximum of these two scenarios.

2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**:
   - The function `find` is a recursive function with memoization that computes the maximum amount that can be robbed for a given range of houses.
   - The base case is when the current index exceeds the end of the range.
   - The memoization array `dp` is used to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one house, return the value of that house directly.

## Functions

- **find**: A recursive helper function that computes the maximum money that can be robbed from a subarray of houses.
- **rob**: The main function that computes the maximum money that can be robbed considering the circular arrangement of houses.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of houses. Each house is processed once for both scenarios.

## Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the use of memoization arrays `dp1` and `dp2`.

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `rob` function. It reads the list of house values and calls the `rob` function to compute the maximum money that can be robbed, printing the result.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int find(vector<int> & nums, int index, int end, vector<int> &dp){
        // base case;
        if(index > end) return 0;
        //dp condition;
        if(dp[index]!= -1)
            return dp[index];
        // condition;
        return dp[index] = max(nums[index]+find(nums,index+2,end,dp), find(nums,index+1,end,dp));
    }

    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 1){
            return nums[0];
        }
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp1(n,-1);
        vector<int> dp2(n,-1);
        return max(find(nums,0,n-2,dp1), find(nums,1,n-1,dp2));
    }
};
