# Climbing Stairs Using Memoization

This repository contains a C++ implementation to solve the "Climbing Stairs" problem using memoization to optimize recursive calls.

## Problem Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Approach

1. **Recursive Function with Memoization**:
   - Define a helper function `step` that calculates the number of distinct ways to reach the top from the current stair.
   - Use a memoization array `dp` to store the results of previously computed steps to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If the value for the current step is already computed and stored in `dp`, return it.
   - Otherwise, compute the value recursively by considering the number of ways to reach the top from the next stair (`stair + 1`) and the next-to-next stair (`stair + 2`), and store it in `dp` before returning.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If the current stair is equal to `n`, return 1 as it means you have reached the top.
   - If the current stair is greater than `n`, return 0 as it means you have exceeded the number of steps.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a vector `dp` with -1 to indicate uncomputed steps.
   - Set `dp[n]` to 1, indicating there's 1 way to stay at the top.
   - Set `dp[n+1]` to 0, indicating there are no ways to climb beyond the top.

4. **Main Function**:
   - The `climbStairs` function initializes the `dp` vector and calls the `step` function to compute the number of distinct ways to reach the top from the 0th stair.

## Functions

- **climbStairs**: Main function to initialize the `dp` vector and call the helper function `step`.
- **step**: Helper function that computes the number of distinct ways to reach the top using memoization.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), because each step from 0 to n is computed exactly once and stored in the memoization array.

## Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for storing the memoization array `dp`.

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `climbStairs` function. It reads the value of `n` and calls the `climbStairs` function to compute the number of distinct ways to reach the top, printing the result.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int step(int stair, int n, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (stair == n)
            return 1;
        if (stair > n)
            return 0;

        // return the result which is already precalculated
        if (dp[stair] != -1) {
            return dp[stair];
        }
        dp[stair] = step(stair + 1, n, dp) + step(stair + 2, n, dp);
        return dp[stair];
    }

    int climbStairs(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 2, -1);
        dp[n] = 1;
        dp[n + 1] = 0;
        return step(0, n, dp);
    }
};
