# Coin Change 2 Problem Using Dynamic Programming

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the "Coin Change 2" problem using a dynamic programming approach with memoization.

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. You need to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have an infinite number of each coin. The order of coins doesn't matter.

## Approach

1. **Recursive Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - The problem is solved using a recursive approach combined with memoization to store the results of subproblems.
   - The function `coinChange` recursively explores two scenarios:
     1. Picking the current coin and reducing the amount accordingly.
     2. Skipping the current coin and moving to the next coin.
   - The base cases are handled as follows:
     - If the `amount` becomes less than 0, the function returns 0, indicating an invalid combination.
     - If the `amount` is exactly 0, the function returns 1, indicating a valid combination.
     - If all coins are exhausted without making up the amount, the function returns 0.
   - The memoization array `dp` is used to store intermediate results for each coin and amount combination to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Top-Down Approach**:
   - The `change` function initializes the memoization table and starts the recursion from the first coin and the given amount.

## Functions

- **coinChange**: A recursive helper function that computes the number of ways to make up the given amount using the coins starting from the specified index.
- **change**: The main function that initializes the memoization table and calls the recursive function to calculate the result.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times \text{amount})\), where `n` is the number of coins. The solution involves exploring each combination of coins and amounts, with memoization reducing the redundant calculations.

## Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times \text{amount})\) for storing the memoization table `dp`.

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `change` function. It reads the list of coins and the amount, and then calls the `change` function to compute the number of ways to make up the amount using the given coins.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(int index, int amount, vector<int> &coins, vector<vector<int>>& dp){
        // base case;
        if( amount < 0 || index >= coins.size()){
            return 0;
        }
        // answer found :)
        if(dp[index][amount] != -1){
            return dp[index][amount];
        }
        
        if(amount == 0){
            return dp[index][amount] = 1;
        }

        // pick the one at the index;  // not pick
        return dp[index][amount] = coinChange(index, amount - coins[index], coins, dp) + coinChange(index + 1, amount, coins, dp); 
    }

    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        int index = 0;
        int n = coins.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(amount + 1, -1));
        return coinChange(index, amount, coins, dp);
    }
};
