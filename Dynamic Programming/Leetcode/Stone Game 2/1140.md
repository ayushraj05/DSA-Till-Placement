# Stone Game II Problem

## Problem Explanation

The problem involves a game played by two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking piles of stones from a line of piles. Each pile has a certain number of stones, and the players aim to maximize the number of stones they collect. The twist in this game is that the number of piles a player can take depends on a variable `M`, which can change dynamically based on previous moves. Alice always starts first.

**Detailed Problem Statement:**
- The game begins with Alice picking up stones first.
- In each turn, the current player can take at least `1` pile and at most `2 * M` piles, where `M` is a value that can change after each move.
- After picking up `x` piles, the next player has the choice of `2 * max(M, x)` piles in the next turn.
- The objective is to calculate the maximum number of stones Alice can collect if both players play optimally.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses dynamic programming and recursion to determine the optimal number of stones Alice can collect. Here's how it works:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:**
   - The `dp` table is a 3D vector `dp[person][i][M]` where:
     - `person` indicates the current player (Alice: `1`, Bob: `0`).
     - `i` is the index of the current pile.
     - `M` is the current value of `M` determining how many piles can be picked.

2. **Recursive Function (solve):**
   - The `solve` function is used to recursively calculate the maximum stones Alice can collect starting from the current pile `i`, with the current player and the current value of `M`.
   - If Alice's turn (`person == 1`), the function tries to maximize the number of stones collected by selecting the optimal number of piles.
   - If Bob's turn (`person == 0`), the function minimizes the number of stones Alice can collect in the future by selecting the optimal number of piles for Bob.
   - The function stores the results in the `dp` table to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If the index `i` exceeds the number of piles (`i >= n`), the function returns `0` because no more piles can be collected.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The solution starts by calling the `solve` function with Alice as the first player, starting from the first pile and with `M = 1`.
   - The result is stored in the `dp` table and returned as the maximum number of stones Alice can collect.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^3)**, where `n` is the number of piles. This is because for each pile and each possible value of `M`, the algorithm may explore multiple branches (up to `n`) due to the recursive calls.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is **O(n^3)**, required to store the 3D `dp` table with dimensions corresponding to the number of players, the number of piles, and the possible values of `M`. Additional space is used by the recursion stack.
