# House Robber Problem Using Optimized Bottom-Up Approach

This repository contains a C++ implementation to solve the "House Robber" problem using a bottom-up approach that optimizes space usage by eliminating the need for a full dynamic programming (DP) array.

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses are arranged in a straight line, and you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Your goal is to maximize the amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming with Space Optimization**:
   - The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by considering the maximum money that can be robbed up to each house.
   - Instead of using a full DP array, which would require `O(n)` space, we reduce space complexity to `O(1)` by maintaining only the last two states (`first` and `second`).

2. **State Transition**:
   - Iterate from the last house to the first. For each house, decide whether to rob it and add its value to the money obtained from robbing non-adjacent houses (`first`), or to skip it and take the maximum amount from the previous house (`second`).
   - The transition is defined as:  
     `third = max(nums[i] + first, second)`.
   - Update `first` and `second` for the next iteration.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `first` and `second` to 0, representing the maximum money that can be robbed beyond the last house.

4. **Result**:
   - After processing all houses, `third` holds the maximum money that can be robbed.

## Functions

- **rob**: Main function to calculate the maximum money that can be robbed using the optimized bottom-up approach.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of houses. Each house is processed once.

## Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as only a few variables (`first`, `second`, `third`) are used instead of a full DP array.

## Usage

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `rob` function. It reads the list of house values and calls the `rob` function to compute the maximum money that can be robbed, printing the result.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int first = 0;
        int second = 0;
        int third = 0;
        for(int i = n - 1; i > -1; i--) {
            third = max(nums[i] + first, second);
            first = second;
            second = third;
        }
        return third;
    }
};
