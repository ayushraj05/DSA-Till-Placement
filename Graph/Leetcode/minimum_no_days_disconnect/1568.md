# Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the problem to find the minimum number of days required to disconnect an island in a grid. The problem is solved by checking the connectivity of the island after removing land cells.

## Problem Description

Given a grid consisting of 0s (water) and 1s (land), the task is to find the minimum number of days required to make the grid disconnected by removing 1 or 2 land cells. The grid is disconnected if there are two or more islands (groups of connected 1s).

## Approach

1. **Check Initial Disconnection**:
   - If the grid is initially disconnected, return 0 because no land needs to be removed.

2. **Try Removing One Land Cell**:
   - Iterate over each land cell. For each cell, temporarily set it to water and check if the grid becomes disconnected. If it does, return 1.

3. **Remove Two Land Cells**:
   - If the grid remains connected after removing one land cell, then at least two cells need to be removed. Return 2 in this case.

### Helper Functions

- **`disconnected()`**:
  - This function checks whether the grid is disconnected. It counts the number of islands using Depth First Search (DFS). If there is more than one island, the grid is considered disconnected.
  
- **`dfs()`**:
  - A Depth First Search function that marks all connected land cells starting from a given cell, helping to determine the extent of the current island.

### Grid Directions

- **Directions Array**:
  - `dirs` is a 2D array that stores the four possible movement directions (right, down, left, up) used during the DFS to explore all adjacent cells.

## Example Usage

Given the following grid:
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> grid = {
    {1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
    {1, 0, 0, 0, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
};
Solution solution;
int result = solution.minDays(grid);
cout << result << endl;
