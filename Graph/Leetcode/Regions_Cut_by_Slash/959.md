# Regions Cut By Slashes Using Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the "Regions Cut By Slashes" problem using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure.

## Problem Description

You are given an `N x N` grid composed of `/`, `\`, and spaces. Each `/` divides a square into two triangles from top-left to bottom-right, and each `\` divides it from top-right to bottom-left. Your task is to return the number of regions in the grid.

## Approach

1. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Structure**:
   - The DSU (or Union-Find) is a data structure that tracks the connected components of a graph. It efficiently supports union and find operations.
   - Each cell in the grid is divided into four triangles (0, 1, 2, and 3). These triangles are represented as separate nodes in the DSU.

2. **Grid Processing**:
   - The `regionsBySlashes` function processes each cell in the grid:
     - Based on whether the cell contains `/` or `\`, it unites different triangles within the cell.
     - It also unites triangles between adjacent cells (right and down neighbors).

3. **Union Operations**:
   - The `unite` function merges two triangles if they belong to the same region.
   - The `find` function finds the representative or root of a triangle.

4. **Count Regions**:
   - After processing the grid, the number of unique roots in the DSU gives the number of distinct regions.

## Classes and Methods

### `DSU` Class

- **`DSU(int N)`**: Constructor initializes a DSU with `N` elements.
- **`int find(int x)`**: Finds and returns the root of element `x`, performing path compression.
- **`void unite(int x, int y)`**: Unites the sets containing `x` and `y`.

### `Solution` Class

- **`int regionsBySlashes(vector<string>& grid)`**: Main function that computes the number of regions formed by the slashes in the grid.

## Example

Given the input grid:
```cpp
vector<string> grid = {
    " /",
    "/ "
};
Solution solution;
int result = solution.regionsBySlashes(grid);
cout << result << endl;
