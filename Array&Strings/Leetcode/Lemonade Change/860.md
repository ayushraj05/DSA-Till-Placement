# Lemonade Change Problem

## Problem Explanation

The problem involves a lemonade stand where each customer pays for their lemonade with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. The cost of one lemonade is $5. The challenge is to determine if the lemonade seller can provide the correct change to each customer in the order they arrive, assuming they start with no money initially.

**Detailed Problem Statement:**
- Each customer pays exactly one $5, $10, or $20 bill.
- For each $5 bill received, no change is required.
- For each $10 bill received, the seller must return $5 as change.
- For each $20 bill received, the seller must return either $15 (one $10 bill and one $5 bill) or three $5 bills as change.
- The goal is to return `true` if the seller can provide the correct change to every customer, otherwise return `false`.

## Solution Approach

The approach taken in this solution is to maintain a count of the $5, $10, and $20 bills that the seller has received so far. As each customer pays, the solution checks the amount of change needed and adjusts the count of the bills accordingly:

1. **Initialization:** Start with `five = 0`, `ten = 0`, and `twenty = 0` representing the count of $5, $10, and $20 bills, respectively.
2. **Processing Each Bill:**
   - If a $5 bill is received, simply increment the `five` counter.
   - If a $10 bill is received, check if there is at least one $5 bill to give as change. If so, decrement the `five` counter and increment the `ten` counter. If not, return `false` because change cannot be provided.
   - If a $20 bill is received, the priority is to give one $10 bill and one $5 bill as change. If that's not possible, the next option is to give three $5 bills as change. If neither option is possible, return `false`.
3. **Final Check:** If all customers are processed and correct change was provided in each case, return `true`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of customers (i.e., the size of the `bills` vector). This is because the solution iterates through each customer exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each bill.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is **O(1)**. The solution only uses a few integer variables (`five`, `ten`, `twenty`) to keep track of the count of each bill, which requires constant space regardless of the size of the input.
