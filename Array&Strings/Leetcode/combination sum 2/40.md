# Combination Sum II Problem

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the `Combination Sum II` problem, which finds all unique combinations in a list of candidate numbers that sum to a given target.

## Problem Description

Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), the task is to find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`. Each number in `candidates` may only be used once in the combination.

The solution must not contain duplicate combinations.

## Approach

1. **Backtracking**:
   - The problem is solved using a backtracking approach. The function `combinationSumHelper` explores all possible combinations by iterating through the `candidates` array, subtracting the current candidate from the `target`, and recursively exploring further.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the `target` becomes zero, the current combination is valid and is added to the list of results (`ans`).

3. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - To avoid duplicate combinations, the algorithm skips over duplicate elements in the `candidates` array by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one.

4. **Sorting and Deduplication**:
   - The `candidates` array is first sorted to make it easier to skip duplicates.
   - After collecting all potential combinations, a set is used to eliminate any remaining duplicates before returning the final answer.

### Helper Function

- **`combinationSumHelper()`**:
  - This recursive function is the core of the backtracking approach. It takes the current index, the remaining `target`, and the partial combination (`v`). It adds valid combinations to the result list (`ans`).

### Algorithm Flow

- **Iteration**:
  - The algorithm iterates over the sorted list of `candidates` starting from the current index.
  - It checks whether the current candidate can be added to the combination (i.e., if the new `target` is non-negative).
  - It skips the candidate if it is a duplicate of the previous one.
  - It continues to explore further combinations by calling the helper function recursively.

## Example Usage

Given the following input:
```cpp
vector<int> candidates = {10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5};
int target = 8;
Solution ob;
vector<vector<int>> ans = ob.combinationSum2(candidates, target);
for (const auto& combination : ans) {
    for (int num : combination) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
