# Fraction Addition and Subtraction Problem

## Problem Explanation

The problem is to perform fraction addition and subtraction given an arithmetic expression containing fractions. The input is a string representing the expression, where each fraction is in the form `a/b`, with `a` being the numerator and `b` the denominator. The fractions are separated by either a plus (`+`) or minus (`-`) sign.

**Detailed Problem Statement:**
- You are given a string `expr` representing an expression that contains several fractions and operators (`+` or `-`).
- The task is to evaluate the expression and return the result as a simplified fraction.
- The result must be in the form `p/q` where `p` is the numerator and `q` is the denominator, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` should be `1`.

For example, given the input `expr = "-1/2+1/2"`, the output should be `"0/1"` as the fractions cancel each other out. For `expr = "1/3-1/2"`, the output should be `"-1/6"`.

## Solution Approach

The solution approach involves parsing the input string to extract individual fractions, performing the necessary arithmetic operations, and simplifying the resulting fraction.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an initial fraction of `0/1`.
   - The numerator `nume` is initialized to `0` and the denominator `deno` to `1`.
   - Traverse through the input string to process each fraction.

2. **Parsing Fractions:**
   - The expression is parsed character by character to extract numerators and denominators.
   - Handle potential signs (`+` or `-`) to determine whether the current fraction is positive or negative.
   - The numerator is extracted first by reading digits until the slash (`/`), followed by the denominator.
   - Adjust the sign of the numerator if a negative sign is encountered.

3. **Fraction Addition/Subtraction:**
   - Convert the current fraction and the running total to a common denominator before adding or subtracting them.
   - Update the running total by adding or subtracting the current fraction using the formula:
     \[
     \text{new numerator} = (\text{current numerator} \times \text{running denominator}) + (\text{running numerator} \times \text{current denominator})
     \]
     \[
     \text{new denominator} = \text{current denominator} \times \text{running denominator}
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Result:**
   - After processing all fractions, simplify the result by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The simplified result is then formatted as a string and returned.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle edge cases such as fractions that cancel out to `0`, ensuring the result is displayed as `"0/1"`.
   - Handle inputs with varying fraction lengths and combinations of positive and negative fractions.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `expr`. This complexity arises from parsing the string and performing arithmetic operations on the fractions.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the solution only uses a fixed amount of extra space for storing the numerators, denominators, and intermediate results, irrespective of the input size.
