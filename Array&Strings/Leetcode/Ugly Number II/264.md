# Nth Ugly Number Problem

## Problem Explanation

The problem is to find the `n`th ugly number, where ugly numbers are positive integers whose prime factors only include `2`, `3`, and `5`. The sequence of ugly numbers starts with `1`, and the subsequent numbers are generated by multiplying the existing ugly numbers by `2`, `3`, or `5` and selecting the smallest new number at each step.

**Detailed Problem Statement:**
- Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are `2`, `3`, or `5`.
- The first ugly number is `1`.
- The sequence continues by generating numbers of the form `2^a * 3^b * 5^c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers.
- The goal is to find the `n`th ugly number in this sequence.

## Solution Approach

The approach used in this solution is a dynamic programming method where the smallest ugly numbers are generated in sequence by maintaining indices for the multiples of `2`, `3`, and `5`.

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Create a vector `ans` of size `n+1` to store the ugly numbers, with `ans[1]` initialized to `1`.
   - Initialize three indices `i2`, `i3`, and `i5` to `1`. These indices represent the current position in the sequence for generating the next multiples of `2`, `3`, and `5` respectively.

2. **Generating Ugly Numbers:**
   - For each position `i` from `2` to `n`, calculate the next potential ugly numbers by multiplying the current value at `i2`, `i3`, and `i5` by `2`, `3`, and `5` respectively.
   - Select the smallest value among these three as the next ugly number and store it in `ans[i]`.
   - If the selected smallest value was generated by multiplying with `2`, increment `i2`. Similarly, increment `i3` or `i5` if the smallest value was generated by multiplying with `3` or `5`.

3. **Final Result:** 
   - After filling up the `ans` array, return `ans[n]` as the `n`th ugly number.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the input parameter indicating the position of the ugly number to be found. The algorithm iterates through each index from `2` to `n` and performs constant-time operations for each index.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, which is required to store the `n` ugly numbers in the `ans` vector. The additional space used by the indices `i2`, `i3`, and `i5` is constant.
